- What happened: a combined presentation patch failed because one later CSS hunk no longer matched after earlier selector edits in the same patch.
- Root cause: the patch bundled dependent selector changes with stale context instead of applying the file-local transformations in smaller hunks.
- Prevention: apply related selector renames and responsive overrides in separate, verifiable patches.

- What happened: the handoff check ran `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream}` through PowerShell and failed before Git executed.
- Root cause: PowerShell parsed `@{upstream}` as a hashtable expression.
- Prevention: quote Git refspecs that begin with `@` in PowerShell, for example `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{upstream}'`.
